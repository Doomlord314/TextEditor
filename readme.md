# The Simplest Text Editor
___
This text editor is probalby not the best, but will get the job done in a hurry!

made using C++/SFML, it was started on April 17, 2019.  
#TODO  
switch fonts, you don't,  Shift + Scroll - zoom in and out  
#Controls  
Shift + Arrows - make cursor faster   
The buttons do what they say  

Just so you know, I wrote this in the text editor
