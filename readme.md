# The Simplest Text Editor
___
This text editor is probalby not the best, but will get the job done in a hurry!

made using C++/SFML, it was started on April 17, 2019.  
it has 3 buttons with big, bold letters on them, figure it out  
to switch fonts, you don't,  
that would be too hard to program  
and would suck even if i did  
CTRL + Scroll - zoom in and out  
Shift + Arrows - make cursor move fastter - TODO Fix it  
Just so you know, I wrote this in the text editor
